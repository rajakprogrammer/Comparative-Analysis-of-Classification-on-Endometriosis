1. There are four general types of endometrial tissue, namely the normal endometrium (NE) within a regular menstrual cycle, endometrial polyp (EP), endometrial hyperplasia (EH), and endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EA), in this dataset.
2. The general class of normal endometrium (NE) has three subtypes defined by the phases of the menstrual cycle, namely the luteal phase, menstrual phase, and follicular phase.
3. The general class of endometrial hyperplasia (EH) has two subtypes, namely ¡°Simple¡± (short for simple hyperplasia without atypia) and ¡°Complex¡± (short for complex hyperplasia without atypia).
4. This dataset was saved as a compressed file in the ZIP file format which had a two-level directory. In particular, all images that belonged to the same subtype of a general class were placed in the same folder at the second level of the directory.
